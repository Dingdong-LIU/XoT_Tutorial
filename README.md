# XoT_Tutorial
A brief tutorial on Chain of Thoughts (CoT), Tree of Thoughts (CoT) and Graph of Thoughts (GoT) based on my own understandings.

## Scenario
Try to use a customer complaint scenario. An agent has certain abilities, it need to try its best to assist a customer. However, it should also be able to turn down unreasonable requests. 

An agent has the following permission:
* Ability to refund, repair or discard a customer's request (politely express it cannot help with the customer).
* Recommend additional add-value services.
* Request for help from a real customer.

Haven't come up with concrete ablities and scenarios.
