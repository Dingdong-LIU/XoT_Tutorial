Examples include OpenAI's GPT-3, which is used in applications like language translation, text summarization, and conversational agents.\\n\\n3. **Landlord and Tenant Law (LLM)**: In some jurisdictions, LLM is used as an abbreviation for specific legal frameworks or courses related to landlord and tenant law.\\n\\nThe meaning of LLM will depend on the context in which it is used.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 209, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 221}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_43dfabdef1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b981d6b7-f469-4d0e-b80f-9c1f440f898b-0')"
